## Issues

If you run into bugs, please raise them on the GitHub repository. Please do not email them to me as GitHub is the appropriate place for them and allows for members of the community to answer questions, particularly if I miss the email. It would also be much appreciated if they could be limited to actual bugs or feature requests. If you're looking at how you could use the plugin to do a particular kind of notification, check the example app provides detailed code samples for each supported feature. Also try to check the README first in case you have missed something e.g. platform-specific setup.
