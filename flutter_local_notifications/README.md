## ‚ö† Caveats and limitations

The cross-platform facing API exposed by the `FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin` class doesn't expose platform-specific methods as its goal is to provide an abstraction for all platforms. As such, platform-specific configuration is passed in as data. There are platform-specific implementations of the plugin that can be obtained by calling the [`resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_local_notifications/latest/flutter_local_notifications/FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin/resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation.html). An example of using this is provided in the section on requesting permissions on iOS. In spite of this, there may still be gaps that don't cover your use case and don't make sense to add as they don't fit with the plugin's architecture or goals. Developers can fork or maintain their own code for showing notifications in these situations.

### Compatibility with firebase_messaging

Previously, there were issues that prevented this plugin working properly with the `firebase_messaging` plugin. This meant that callbacks from each plugin might not be invoked. This has been resolved since version 6.0.13 of the `firebase_messaging` plugin so please make sure you are using more recent versions of the  `firebase_messaging` plugin and follow the steps covered in `firebase_messaging`'s readme file located [here](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging)

### Scheduled Android notifications

Some Android OEMs have their own customised Android OS that can prevent applications from running in the background. Consequently, scheduled notifications may not work when the application is in the background on certain devices (e.g. by Xiaomi, Huawei). If you experience problems like this then this would be the reason why. As it's a restriction imposed by the OS, this is not something that can be resolved by the plugin. Some devices may have setting that lets users control which applications run in the background. The steps for these can vary but it is still up to the users of your application to do given it's a setting on the phone itself. The site https://dontkillmyapp.com provides details on how to do this for various devices.

It has been reported that Samsung's implementation of Android has imposed a maximum of 500 alarms that can be scheduled via the [Alarm Manager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager) API and exceptions can occur when going over the limit.

### iOS pending notifications limit

There is a limit imposed by iOS where it will only keep 64 notifications that will fire the soonest.

### Scheduled notifications and daylight saving time

The notification APIs used on iOS versions older than 10 (aka the `UILocalNotification` APIs) have limited supported for time zones.

### Updating application badge

This plugin doesn't provide APIs for directly setting the badge count for your application. If you need this for your application, there are other plugins available, such as the [`flutter_app_badger`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_app_badger) plugin.

### Custom notification sounds

[iOS and macOS restrictions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationsound?language=objc) apply (e.g. supported file formats).

### macOS differences

Due to limitations currently within the macOS Flutter engine, `getNotificationAppLaunchDetails` will return null on macOS versions older than 10.14. These limitations will mean that conflicts may occur when using this plugin with other notification plugins (e.g. for push notifications).

The `schedule`, `showDailyAtTime` and `showWeeklyAtDayAndTime` methods that were implemented before macOS support was added and have been marked as deprecated aren't implemented on macOS.

### Linux limitations

Capabilities depend on the system notification server implementation, therefore, not all features listed in `LinuxNotificationDetails` may be supported. One of the ways to check some capabilities is to call the `LinuxFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.getCapabilities()` method.

Scheduled/pending notifications is currently not supported due to the lack of a scheduler API.

The `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` callback runs on the main isolate of the running application and cannot be launched in the background if the application is not running. To respond to notification after the application is terminated, your application should be registered as DBus activatable (please see [DBusApplicationLaunching](https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/DBusApplicationLaunching) for more information), and register action before activating the application. This is difficult to do in a plugin because plugins instantiate during application activation, so `getNotificationAppLaunchDetails` can't be implemented without changing the main user application.

### Notification payload

Due to some limitations on iOS with how it treats null values in dictionaries, a null notification payload is coalesced to an empty string behind the scenes on all platforms for consistency.

## üîß Android Setup

Before proceeding, please make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin. The reason for this is that since version 3.0.1+4, the amount of setup needed has been reduced. Previously, applications needed changes done to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file and there was a bit more setup needed for release builds. If for some reason, your application still needs to use an older version of the plugin then make use of the release tags to refer back to older versions of readme.

### Gradle setup

Version 10+ on the plugin now relies on [desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#j8-library-desugaring) to support scheduled notifications with backwards compatibility on older versions of Android. Developers will need to update their application's Gradle file at `android/app/build.gradle`. Please see the link on desugaring for details but the main parts needed in this Gradle file would be

```gradle
android {
  defaultConfig {
    multiDexEnabled true
  }

  compileOptions {
    // Flag to enable support for the new language APIs
    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
    // Sets Java compatibility to Java 8
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
}

dependencies {
  coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.1.5'
}
```

Note that the plugin uses Android Gradle plugin 4.2.2 to leverage this functionality so applications would also need to use that version at a **minimum**. For a Flutter project, this is specified in `android/build.gradle` and the main parts would look similar to the following

```gradle
buildscript {
   ...

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.2.2'
        ...
    }
```

There have been reports that enabling desugaring may result in a Flutter apps crashing on Android 12L and above. This would be an issue with Flutter itself, not the plugin. One possible fix is adding the [WindowManager library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/window) as a dependency:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.window:window:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.window:window-java:1.0.0'
    ...
}
```

More information and other proposed solutions can be found in [Flutter issue #110658](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/110658).

The plugin also requires that the `compileSdkVersion` in your application's Gradle file is set to 33:

```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33
    ...
}
```

### Requesting permissions on Android 13 or higher

From Android 13 (API level 33) onwards, apps now have the ability to display a prompt where users can decide if they want to grant an app permission to show notifications. For further reading on this matter read https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notification-permission. To support this applications need target their application to Android 13 or higher and the compile SDK version needs to be at least 33 (Android 13). For example, to target Android 13, update your app's `build.gradle` file to have a `targetSdkVersion` of `33`. Applications can then call the following code to request the permission where the `requestPermission` method is associated with the `AndroidFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin` class (i.e. the Android implementation of the plugin)

```
FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin =
        FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin();
flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<
    AndroidFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>().requestPermission();
```

### Custom notification icons and sounds

Notification icons should be added as a drawable resource. The example project/code shows how to set default icon for all notifications and how to specify one for each notification. It is possible to use launcher icon/mipmap and this by default is `@mipmap/ic_launcher` in the Android manifest and can be passed `AndroidInitializationSettings` constructor. However, the offical Android guidance is that you should use drawable resources. Custom notification sounds should be added as a raw resource and the sample illustrates how to play a notification with a custom sound. Refer to the following links around Android resources and notification icons.

 * [Notifications](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/image-asset-studio#notification)
 * [Providing resources](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources)
 * [Creating notification icon with Image Asset Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/create-app-icons#create-notification)

When specifying the large icon bitmap or big picture bitmap (associated with the big picture style), bitmaps can be either a drawable resource or file on the device. This is specified via a single property (e.g. the `largeIcon` property associated with the `AndroidNotificationDetails` class) where a value that is an instance of the `DrawableResourceAndroidBitmap` means the bitmap should be loaded from an drawable resource. If this is an instance of the `FilePathAndroidBitmap`, this indicates it should be loaded from a file referred to by a given file path.

‚ö†Ô∏è For Android 8.0+, sounds and vibrations are associated with notification channels and can only be configured when they are first created. Showing/scheduling a notification will create a channel with the specified id if it doesn't exist already. If another notification specifies the same channel id but tries to specify another sound or vibration pattern then nothing occurs.

### Full-screen intent notifications

If your application needs the ability to schedule full-screen intent notifications, add the following attributes to the activity you're opening. For a Flutter application, there is typically only one activity extends from `FlutterActivity`. These attributes ensure the screen turns on and shows when the device is locked.

```xml
<activity
    android:showWhenLocked="true"
    android:turnScreenOn="true">
```

For reference, the example app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file can be found [here](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/blob/master/flutter_local_notifications/example/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml).

Note that when a full-screen intent notification actually occurs (as opposed to a heads-up notification that the system may decide should occur), the plugin will act as though the user has tapped on a notification so handle those the same way (e.g. `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` callback) to display the appropriate page for your application.

### Release build configuration

Before creating the release build of your app (which is the default setting when building an APK or app bundle) you will need to customise your ProGuard configuration file as per this [link](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#keep-code). Rules specific to the GSON dependency being used by the plugin will need to be added. These rules can be found [here](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/examples/android-proguard-example/proguard.cfg). Whilst the example app has a Proguard rules (`proguard-rules.pro`) [here](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/blob/master/flutter_local_notifications/example/android/app/proguard-rules.pro), it is recommended that developers refer to the rules on the GSON repository in case they get updated over time.

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that you have configured the resources that should be kept so that resources like your notification icons aren't discarded by the R8 compiler by following the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#keep-resources). If you have chosen to use `@mipmap/ic_launcher` as the notification icon (against the official Android guidance), be sure to include this in the `keep.xml` file. If you fail to do this, notifications might be broken. In the worst case they will never show, instead silently failing when the system looks for a resource that has been removed. If they do still show, you might not see the icon you specified. The configuration used by the example app can be found [here](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/blob/master/flutter_local_notifications/example/android/app/src/main/res/raw/keep.xml) where it is specifying that all drawable resources should be kept, as well as the file used to play a custom notification sound (sound file is located [here](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/blob/master/flutter_local_notifications/example/android/app/src/main/res/raw/slow_spring_board.mp3)).

## üîß iOS setup

### General setup

Add the following lines to the `application` method in the AppDelegate.m/AppDelegate.swift file of your iOS project. See an example of this [here](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/blob/master/flutter_local_notifications/example/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift).

Objective-C:
```objc
if (@available(iOS 10.0, *)) {
  [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter].delegate = (id<UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate>) self;
}
```

Swift:
```swift
if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
  UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self as? UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate
}
```

### Handling notifications whilst the app is in the foreground

By design, iOS applications *do not* display notifications while the app is in the foreground unless configured to do so.

For iOS 10+, use the presentation options to control the behaviour for when a notification is triggered while the app is in the foreground. The default settings of the plugin will configure these such that a notification will be displayed when the app is in the foreground.

For older versions of iOS, you need to handle the callback as part of specifying the method that should be fired to the `onDidReceiveLocalNotification` argument when creating an instance `DarwinInitializationSettings` object that is passed to the function for initializing the plugin.

Here is an example:

```dart
// initialise the plugin. app_icon needs to be a added as a drawable resource to the Android head project
const AndroidInitializationSettings initializationSettingsAndroid =
    AndroidInitializationSettings('app_icon');
final DarwinInitializationSettings initializationSettingsDarwin =
    DarwinInitializationSettings(
        onDidReceiveLocalNotification: onDidReceiveLocalNotification);
final LinuxInitializationSettings initializationSettingsLinux =
    LinuxInitializationSettings(
        defaultActionName: 'Open notification');
final InitializationSettings initializationSettings = InitializationSettings(
    android: initializationSettingsAndroid,
    iOS: initializationSettingsDarwin,
    linux: initializationSettingsLinux);
flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(initializationSettings,
    onDidReceiveNotificationResponse: onDidReceiveNotificationResponse);

...

void onDidReceiveLocalNotification(
    int id, String title, String body, String payload) async {
  // display a dialog with the notification details, tap ok to go to another page
  showDialog(
    context: context,
    builder: (BuildContext context) => CupertinoAlertDialog(
      title: Text(title),
      content: Text(body),
      actions: [
        CupertinoDialogAction(
          isDefaultAction: true,
          child: Text('Ok'),
          onPressed: () async {
            Navigator.of(context, rootNavigator: true).pop();
            await Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(
                builder: (context) => SecondScreen(payload),
              ),
            );
          },
        )
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

## ‚ùì Usage

Before going on to copy-paste the code snippets in this section, double-check you have configured your application correctly.
If you encounter any issues please refer to the API docs and the sample code in the `example` directory before opening a request on Github.

### Notification Actions

Notifications can now contain actions but note that on Apple's platforms, these only on iOS 10 or newer and macOS 10.14 or newer.  On macOS and Linux (see [Linux limitations](#linux-limitations) chapter), these will only run on the main isolate by calling the `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` callback. On iOS and Android, these will run on the main isolate by calling the `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` callback if the configuration has specified that the app/user interface should be shown i.e. by specifying the `DarwinNotificationActionOption.foreground` option on iOS and the `showsUserInterface` property on Android. If they haven't, then these actions may be selected by the user when an app is sleeping or terminated and will wake up your app. However, it may not wake up the user-visible part of your App; but only the part of it which runs in the background. This is done by spawning a background isolate.

This plugin contains handlers for iOS & Android to handle these background isolate cases and will allow you to specify a Dart entry point (a function).
When the user selects a action, the plugin will start a **separate Flutter Engine** which will then invoke the `onDidReceiveBackgroundNotificationResponse` callback

**Configuration**:

*Android* and *Linux* do not require any configuration.

*iOS* will require a few steps:

Adjust `AppDelegate.m` and set the plugin registrant callback:

If you're using Objective-C, add this function anywhere in AppDelegate.m:
``` objc
// This is required for calling FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback method.
#import <FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.h>
...
...
void registerPlugins(NSObject<FlutterPluginRegistry>* registry) {
    [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:registry];
}
```

then extend `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` and register the callback:

``` objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:self];

    // Add this method    
    [FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin setPluginRegistrantCallback:registerPlugins];
}
```

For Swift, open the `AppDelegate.swift` and update the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` as follows
where the commented code indicates the code to add in and why

```swift
import UIKit
import Flutter
// This is required for calling FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback method.
import flutter_local_notifications

@UIApplicationMain
override func application(
  _ application: UIApplication,
  didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
  ) -> Bool {
  // This is required to make any communication available in the action isolate.
  FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback { (registry) in
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: registry)
  }

  ...
  return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
}
```

On iOS/macOS, notification actions need to be configured before the app is started using the `initialize` method

``` dart
final DarwinInitializationSettings initializationSettingsDarwin = DarwinInitializationSettings(
    // ...
    notificationCategories: [
    const DarwinNotificationCategory(
        'demoCategory',
        <DarwinNotificationAction>[
            DarwinNotificationAction('id_1', 'Action 1'),
            DarwinNotificationAction(
            'id_2',
            'Action 2',
            options: <DarwinNotificationActionOption>{
                DarwinNotificationActionOption.destructive,
            },
            ),
            DarwinNotificationAction(
            'id_3',
            'Action 3',
            options: <DarwinNotificationActionOption>{
                DarwinNotificationActionOption.foreground,
            },
            ),
        ],
        options: <DarwinNotificationCategoryOption>{
            DarwinNotificationCategoryOption.hiddenPreviewShowTitle,
        },
    )
],
```

On iOS/macOS, the notification category will define which actions are availble. On Android and Linux, you can put the actions directly in the `AndroidNotificationDetails` and `LinuxNotificationDetails` classes.

**Usage**:

You need to configure a **top level** or **static** method which will handle the action:

``` dart
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
void notificationTapBackground(NotificationResponse notificationResponse) {
  // handle action
}
```

Specify this function as a parameter in the `initialize` method of this plugin:

``` dart
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(
    initializationSettings,
    onDidReceiveNotificationResponse: (NotificationResponse notificationResponse) async {
        // ...
    },
    onDidReceiveBackgroundNotificationResponse: notificationTapBackground,
);
```

Remember this function runs (except Linux) in a separate isolate! This function also requires the `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` annotation to ensure that tree-shaking doesn't remove the code since it would be invoked on the native side. See [here](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/runtime/docs/compiler/aot/entry_point_pragma.md) for official documentation on the annotation.

Developers should also note that whilst accessing plugins will work, on Android there is **no** access to the `Activity` context. This means some plugins (like `url_launcher`) will require additional flags to start the main `Activity` again.

**Specifying actions on notifications**:

The notification actions are platform specific and you have to specify them differently for each platform.

On iOS/macOS, the actions are defined on a category, please see the configuration section for details.

On Android and Linux, the actions are configured directly on the notification.

``` dart
Future<void> _showNotificationWithActions() async {
  const AndroidNotificationDetails androidNotificationDetails =
      AndroidNotificationDetails(
    '...',
    '...',
    '...',
    actions: <AndroidNotificationAction>[
      AndroidNotificationAction('id_1', 'Action 1'),
      AndroidNotificationAction('id_2', 'Action 2'),
      AndroidNotificationAction('id_3', 'Action 3'),
    ],
  );
  const NotificationDetails notificationDetails =
      NotificationDetails(android: androidNotificationDetails);
  await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
      0, '...', '...', notificationDetails);
}
```

Each notification will have a internal ID & an public action title.

### Example app

The [`example`](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/tree/master/flutter_local_notifications/example) directory has a sample application that demonstrates the features of this plugin.

### API reference

Checkout the lovely [API documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_local_notifications/latest/flutter_local_notifications/flutter_local_notifications-library.html) generated by pub.

## Initialisation

The first step is to create a new instance of the plugin class and then initialise it with the settings to use for each platform

```dart
FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin =
    FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin();
// initialise the plugin. app_icon needs to be a added as a drawable resource to the Android head project
const AndroidInitializationSettings initializationSettingsAndroid =
    AndroidInitializationSettings('app_icon');
final DarwinInitializationSettings initializationSettingsDarwin =
    DarwinInitializationSettings(
        onDidReceiveLocalNotification: onDidReceiveLocalNotification);
final LinuxInitializationSettings initializationSettingsLinux =
    LinuxInitializationSettings(
        defaultActionName: 'Open notification');
final InitializationSettings initializationSettings = InitializationSettings(
    android: initializationSettingsAndroid,
    iOS: initializationSettingsDarwin,
    macOS: initializationSettingsDarwin,
    linux: initializationSettingsLinux);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(initializationSettings,
    onDidReceiveNotificationResponse: onDidReceiveNotificationResponse);
```

Initialisation can be done in the `main` function of your application or can be done within the first page shown in your app. Developers can refer to the example app that has code for the initialising within the `main` function. The code above has been simplified for explaining the concepts. Here we have specified the default icon to use for notifications on Android (refer to the *Android setup* section) and designated the function (`onDidReceiveNotificationResponse`) that should fire when a notification has been tapped on via the `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` callback. Specifying this callback is entirely optional but here it will trigger navigation to another page and display the payload associated with the notification. This callback **cannot** be used to handle when a notification launched an app. Use the `getNotificationAppLaunchDetails` method when the app starts if you need to handle when a notification triggering the launch for an app e.g. change the home route of the app for deep-linking.

Note that all settings are nullable, because we don't want to force developers so specify settings for platforms they don't target. You will get a runtime ArgumentError Exception if you forgot to pass the settings for the platform you target.

```dart
void onDidReceiveNotificationResponse(NotificationResponse notificationResponse) async {
    final String? payload = notificationResponse.payload;
    if (notificationResponse.payload != null) {
      debugPrint('notification payload: $payload');
    }
    await Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute<void>(builder: (context) => SecondScreen(payload)),
    );
}
```

In the real world, this payload could represent the id of the item you want to display the details of. Once the initialisation is complete, then you can manage the displaying of notifications. Note that this callback is only intended to work when the app is running. For scenarios where your application needs to handle when a notification launched the app refer to [here](#getting-details-on-if-the-app-was-launched-via-a-notification-created-by-this-plugin)

The `DarwinInitializationSettings` class provides default settings on how the notification be presented when it is triggered and the application is in the foreground on iOS/macOS. There are optional named parameters that can be modified to suit your application's purposes. Here, it is omitted and the default values for these named properties is set such that all presentation options (alert, sound, badge) are enabled. 

The `LinuxInitializationSettings` class requires a name for the default action that calls the `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` callback when the notification is clicked. 

On iOS and macOS, initialisation may show a prompt to requires users to give the application permission to display notifications (note: permissions don't need to be requested on Android). Depending on when this happens, this may not be the ideal user experience for your application. If so, please refer to the next section on how to work around this.

For an explanation of the `onDidReceiveLocalNotification` callback associated with the `DarwinInitializationSettings` class, please read [this](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/tree/master/flutter_local_notifications#handling-notifications-whilst-the-app-is-in-the-foreground).

### [iOS (all supported versions) and macOS 10.14+] Requesting notification permissions

The constructor for the `DarwinInitializationSettings` class  has three named parameters (`requestSoundPermission`, `requestBadgePermission` and `requestAlertPermission`) that controls which permissions are being requested. If you want to request permissions at a later point in your application on iOS, set all of the above to false when initialising the plugin.

```dart
  FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin =
      FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin();
  const AndroidInitializationSettings initializationSettingsAndroid =
      AndroidInitializationSettings('app_icon');
  final DarwinInitializationSettings initializationSettingsDarwin =
      DarwinInitializationSettings(
    requestSoundPermission: false,
    requestBadgePermission: false,
    requestAlertPermission: false,
    onDidReceiveLocalNotification: onDidReceiveLocalNotification,
  );
  final MacOSInitializationSettings initializationSettingsMacOS =
      MacOSInitializationSettings(
          requestAlertPermission: false,
          requestBadgePermission: false,
          requestSoundPermission: false);
  final LinuxInitializationSettings initializationSettingsLinux =
    LinuxInitializationSettings(
        defaultActionName: 'Open notification');
  final InitializationSettings initializationSettings = InitializationSettings(
      android: initializationSettingsAndroid,
      iOS: initializationSettingsDarwin,
      macOS: initializationSettingsDarwin,
      linux: initializationSettingsLinux);
  await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(initializationSettings,
      onDidReceiveNotificationResponse: onDidReceiveNotificationResponse);
```

Then call the `requestPermissions` method with desired permissions at the appropriate point in your application

For iOS:

```dart
final bool result = await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin
    .resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<
        IOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>()
    ?.requestPermissions(
    alert: true,
    badge: true,
    sound: true,
    );
```

For macOS:

```dart
final bool result = await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin
    .resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<
        MacOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>()
    ?.requestPermissions(
    alert: true,
    badge: true,
    sound: true,
    );
```

Here the call to `flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<IOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>()` returns the iOS implementation of the plugin that contains APIs specific to iOS if the application is running on iOS. Similarly, the macOS implementation is returned by calling `flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<MacOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>()`. The `?.` operator is used as the result will be null when run on other platforms. Developers may alternatively choose to guard this call by checking the platform their application is running on.

### Displaying a notification

```dart
const AndroidNotificationDetails androidNotificationDetails =
    AndroidNotificationDetails('your channel id', 'your channel name',
        channelDescription: 'your channel description',
        importance: Importance.max,
        priority: Priority.high,
        ticker: 'ticker');
const NotificationDetails notificationDetails =
    NotificationDetails(android: androidNotificationDetails);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
    0, 'plain title', 'plain body', notificationDetails,
    payload: 'item x');
```

Here, the first argument is the id of notification and is common to all methods that would result in a notification being shown. This is typically set a unique value per notification as using the same id multiple times would result in a notification being updated/overwritten.

The details specific to the Android platform are also specified. This includes the channel details that is required for Android 8.0+. Whilst not shown, it's possible to specify details for iOS and macOS as well using the optional `iOS` and `macOS` named parameters if needed. The payload has been specified ('item x'), that will passed back through your application when the user has tapped on a notification. Note that for Android devices that notifications will only in appear in the tray and won't appear as a toast aka heads-up notification unless things like the priority/importance has been set appropriately. Refer to the Android docs (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html#Heads-up) for additional information. The "ticker" text is passed here is optional and specific to Android. This allows for text to be shown in the status bar on older versions of Android when the notification is shown.

### Scheduling a notification

Starting in version 2.0 of the plugin, scheduling notifications now requires developers to specify a date and time relative to a specific time zone. This is to solve issues with daylight saving time that existed in the `schedule` method that is now deprecated. A new `zonedSchedule` method is provided that expects an instance `TZDateTime` class provided by the [`timezone`](https://pub.dev/packages/timezone) package. Even though the `timezone` package is be a transitive dependency via this plugin, it is recommended based on [this lint rule](https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/depend_on_referenced_packages.html) that you also add the `timezone` package as a direct dependency. 

Once the depdendency as been added, usage of the `timezone` package requires initialisation that is covered in the package's readme. For convenience the following are code snippets used by the example app.

Import the `timezone` package

```dart
import 'package:timezone/data/latest_all.dart' as tz;
import 'package:timezone/timezone.dart' as tz;
```

Initialise the time zone database

```dart
tz.initializeTimeZones();
```

Once the time zone database has been initialised, developers may optionally want to set a default local location/time zone

```dart
tz.setLocalLocation(tz.getLocation(timeZoneName));
```

The `timezone` package doesn't provide a way to obtain the current time zone on the device so developers will need to use [platform channels](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-channels) or use other packages that may be able to provide the information. [`flutter_timezone`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_timezone) is the current version of the original `flutter_native_timezone` plugin used in the example app.

Assuming the local location has been set, the `zonedSchedule` method can then be called in a manner similar to the following code

```dart
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.zonedSchedule(
    0,
    'scheduled title',
    'scheduled body',
    tz.TZDateTime.now(tz.local).add(const Duration(seconds: 5)),
    const NotificationDetails(
        android: AndroidNotificationDetails(
            'your channel id', 'your channel name',
            channelDescription: 'your channel description')),
    androidScheduleMode: AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle,
    uiLocalNotificationDateInterpretation:
        UILocalNotificationDateInterpretation.absoluteTime);
```

On Android, the `androidScheduleMode` is used to determine the precision on when the notification would be delivered. In this example, it's been specified that it should appear at the exact time even when the device has entered a low-powered idle mode. Note that this requires that the exact alarm permission has been granted. If it's been revoked then the plugin will log an error message. Note that if the notification was scheduled to be recurring one but the permission had been revoked then it will no be scheduled as well. In either case, this is where developers may choose to schedule inexact notifications instead via the `androidScheduleMode` parameter.

The `uiLocalNotificationDateInterpretation` is required as on iOS versions older than 10 as time zone support is limited. This means it's not possible schedule a notification for another time zone and have iOS adjust the time the notification will appear when daylight saving time happens. With this parameter, it is used to determine if the scheduled date should be interpreted as absolute time or wall clock time.

There is an optional `matchDateTimeComponents` parameter that can be used to schedule a notification to appear on a daily or weekly basis by telling the plugin to match on the time or a combination of day of the week and time respectively.

If you are trying to update your code so it doesn't use the deprecated methods for showing daily or weekly notifications that occur on a specific day of the week then you'll need to perform calculations that would determine the next instance of a date that meets the conditions for your application. See the example application that shows one of the ways that can be done e.g. how schedule a weekly notification to occur on Monday 10:00AM.

### Periodically show a notification with a specified interval

```dart
const AndroidNotificationDetails androidNotificationDetails =
    AndroidNotificationDetails(
        'repeating channel id', 'repeating channel name',
        channelDescription: 'repeating description');
const NotificationDetails notificationDetails =
    NotificationDetails(android: androidNotificationDetails);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.periodicallyShow(0, 'repeating title',
    'repeating body', RepeatInterval.everyMinute, notificationDetails,
    androidAllowWhileIdle: true);
```

### Retrieving pending notification requests

```dart
final List<PendingNotificationRequest> pendingNotificationRequests =
    await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.pendingNotificationRequests();
```

### Retrieving active notifications




```dart
final List<ActiveNotification> activeNotifications =
    await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.getActiveNotifications();
```

**Note**: The API only works for the following operating systems and versions
- Android 6.0 or newer
- iOS 10.0 or newer
- macOS 10.14 or newer

### Grouping notifications

#### iOS

For iOS, you can specify `threadIdentifier` in `DarwinNotificationDetails`. Notifications with the same `threadIdentifier` will get grouped together automatically.

```dart
const DarwinNotificationDetails iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    DarwinNotificationDetails(threadIdentifier: 'thread_id');
```

#### Android

This is a "translation" of the sample available at https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/group.html

```dart
const String groupKey = 'com.android.example.WORK_EMAIL';
const String groupChannelId = 'grouped channel id';
const String groupChannelName = 'grouped channel name';
const String groupChannelDescription = 'grouped channel description';
// example based on https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/group.html
const AndroidNotificationDetails firstNotificationAndroidSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails(groupChannelId, groupChannelName,
        channelDescription: groupChannelDescription,
        importance: Importance.max,
        priority: Priority.high,
        groupKey: groupKey);
const NotificationDetails firstNotificationPlatformSpecifics =
    NotificationDetails(android: firstNotificationAndroidSpecifics);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(1, 'Alex Faarborg',
    'You will not believe...', firstNotificationPlatformSpecifics);
const AndroidNotificationDetails secondNotificationAndroidSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails(groupChannelId, groupChannelName,
        channelDescription: groupChannelDescription,
        importance: Importance.max,
        priority: Priority.high,
        groupKey: groupKey);
const NotificationDetails secondNotificationPlatformSpecifics =
    NotificationDetails(android: secondNotificationAndroidSpecifics);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
    2,
    'Jeff Chang',
    'Please join us to celebrate the...',
    secondNotificationPlatformSpecifics);

// Create the summary notification to support older devices that pre-date
/// Android 7.0 (API level 24).
///
/// Recommended to create this regardless as the behaviour may vary as
/// mentioned in https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/group
const List<String> lines = <String>[
    'Alex Faarborg  Check this out',
    'Jeff Chang    Launch Party'
];
const InboxStyleInformation inboxStyleInformation = InboxStyleInformation(
    lines,
    contentTitle: '2 messages',
    summaryText: 'janedoe@example.com');
const AndroidNotificationDetails androidNotificationDetails =
    AndroidNotificationDetails(groupChannelId, groupChannelName,
        channelDescription: groupChannelDescription,
        styleInformation: inboxStyleInformation,
        groupKey: groupKey,
        setAsGroupSummary: true);
const NotificationDetails notificationDetails =
    NotificationDetails(android: androidNotificationDetails);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
    3, 'Attention', 'Two messages', notificationDetails);
```

### Cancelling/deleting a notification

```dart
// cancel the notification with id value of zero
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.cancel(0);
```

### Cancelling/deleting all notifications

```dart
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.cancelAll();
```

### Getting details on if the app was launched via a notification created by this plugin

```dart
final NotificationAppLaunchDetails? notificationAppLaunchDetails =
    await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.getNotificationAppLaunchDetails();
```

### [iOS only] Periodic notifications showing up after reinstallation

If you have set notifications to be shown periodically on older iOS versions (< 10) and the application was uninstalled without cancelling all alarms, then the next time it's installed you may see the "old" notifications being fired. If this is not the desired behaviour then you can add code similar to the following to the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your `AppDelegate` class.


Objective-C:

```objc
if(![[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]objectForKey:@"Notification"]){
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] cancelAllLocalNotifications];
    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]setBool:YES forKey:@"Notification"];
}
```

Swift:

```swift
if(!UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "Notification")) {
    UIApplication.shared.cancelAllLocalNotifications()
    UserDefaults.standard.set(true, forKey: "Notification")
}
```

## üìà Testing

As the plugin class is not static, it is possible to mock and verify its behaviour when writing tests as part of your application.
Check the source code for a sample test suite that has been kindly implemented (_test/flutter_local_notifications_test.dart_) that demonstrates how this can be done.

If you decide to use the plugin class directly as part of your tests, the methods will be mostly no-op and methods that return data will return default values.

Part of this is because the plugin detects if you're running on a supported plugin to determine which platform implementation of the plugin should be used. If the platform isn't supported, it will default to the aforementioned behaviour to reduce friction when writing tests. If this not desired then consider using mocks.

If a platform-specific implementation of the plugin is required for your tests, use the [debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride.html) property provided by the Flutter framework.
