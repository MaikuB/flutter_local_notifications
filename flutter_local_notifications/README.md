# flutter_local_notifications

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_local_notifications.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_local_notifications)
[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/master)

A cross platform plugin for displaying local notifications. 

## üì± Supported platforms
* **Android API 16+** (4.1+, the minimum version supported by Flutter). Uses the NotificationCompat APIs so it can be run older Android devices
* **iOS 8.0+** (the minimum version supported by Flutter). Supports the old and new iOS notification APIs (the User Notifications Framework introduced in iOS 10 but will use the UILocalNotification APIs for devices predating iOS 10)

## ‚ú® Features

* Mockable (plugin and API methods aren't static)
* Display basic notifications
* Scheduling when notifications should appear
* Periodically show a notification (interval based)
* Schedule a notification to be shown daily at a specified time
* Schedule a notification to be shown weekly on a specified day and time
* Retrieve a list of pending notification requests that have been scheduled to be shown in the future
* Cancelling/removing notification by id or all of them
* Specify a custom notification sound
* Ability to handle when a user has tapped on a notification, when the app is the foreground, background or terminated
* Determine if an app was launched due to tapping on a notification
* [Android] Configuring the importance level

* [Android] Customising the vibration pattern for notifications
* [Android] Configure the default icon for all notifications
* [Android] Configure the icon for each notification (overrides the default when specified)
* [Android] Configure the large icon for each notification. The icon can be a drawable or a file on the device
* [Android] Formatting notification content via ([HTML markup](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html#StylingWithHTML))
* [Android] Support for the following notification styles
    * Big picture
    * Big text
    * Inbox
    * Messaging

## ‚ö† Caveats and limitations
The cross-platform facing API exposed by the `FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin` class doesn't expose platform-specific methods as its goal is to provide an abstraction for all platforms. As such, platform-specific configuration is passed in as data. There are platform-specific implementations of the plugin that can be obtained by calling the [`resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_local_notifications/latest/flutter_local_notifications/FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin/resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation.html). An example of using this is provided in the section on requesting permissions on iOS. In spite of this, there may still be gaps that don't cover your use case and don't make sense to add as they don't fit with the plugin's architecture or goals. Developers can fork or maintain their own code for showing notifications in these situations.

##### Compatibility with firebase_messaging
Previously, there were issues that prevented this plugin working properly with the `firebase_messaging` plugin. This meant that callbacks from each plugin might not be invoked. Version 6.0.13 of `firebase_messaging` should resolve this issue so please bump your `firebase_messaging` dependency and follow the steps covered in `firebase_messaging`'s readme file.

##### Scheduled Android notifications
Some Android OEMs have their own customised Android OS that can prevent applications from running in the background. Consequently, scheduled notifications may not work when the application is in the background on certain devices (e.g. by Xiaomi, Huawei). If you experience problems like this then this would be the reason why. As it's a restriction imposed by the OS, this is not something that can be resolved by the plugin. Some devices may have setting that lets users control which applications run in the background. The steps for these can be vary and but is still up to the users of your application to do given it's a setting on the phone itself.

##### Recurring Android notifications
This feature uses the [Alarm Manager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager) API. This is standard practice but does mean the delivery of the notifications/alarms are inexact and this is documented Android behaviour as per the previous link. It has been reported that Samsung's implementation of Android has imposed a maximum of 500 alarms that can be scheduled via this API and exceptions can occur when going over the limit.

##### iOS pending notifications limit
There is a limit imposed by iOS where it will only keep 64 notifications that will fire the soonest

##### Scheduled notifications and daylight savings
Daylight saving issues for scheduled notifications is a known issue. This functionality may be deprecated to be replaced by another that only deals with elapsed time since epoch instead of a date.

##### Custom notification sounds
[iOS restrictions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationsound?language=objc) apply (e.g. supported file formats)

## üìà Testing

As the plugin class is not static, it is possible to mock and verify its behaviour when writing tests as part of your application. 
Check the source code for a sample test suite that has been kindly implemented (_test/flutter_local_notifications_test.dart_) that demonstrates how this can be done. 

If you decide to use the plugin class directly as part of your tests, the methods will be mostly no-op and methods that return data will return default values. 

Part of this is because the plugin detects if you're running on a supported plugin to determine which platform implementation of the plugin should be used. If it's neither Android or iOS, then it defaults to the aforementioned behaviour to reduce friction when writing tests. If this not desired then consider using mocks. 

Note there is also a [named constructor](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_local_notifications/latest/flutter_local_notifications/FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin/FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.private.html) that can be used to pass the platform for the plugin to resolve the desired platform-specific implementation.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Android Setup

#### Custom notification icons and sounds

Notification icons should be added as a drawable resource. The example project/code shows how to set default icon for all notifications and how to specify one for each notification. It is possible to use launcher icon/mipmap and this by default is `@mipmap/ic_launcher` in the Android manifest and can be passed `AndroidInitializationSettings` constructor. However, the offical Android guidance is that you should use drawable resources. Custom notification sounds should be added as a raw resource and the sample illustrates how to play a notification with a custom sound. Refer to the following links around Android resources and notification icons.

 * [Notifications](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/image-asset-studio#notification)
 * [Providing resources](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources)
 * [Icon design status bar](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_status_bar)


When specifying the large icon bitmap or big picture bitmap (associated with the big picture style), bitmaps can be either a drawable resource or file on the device. This is specified via a single property (e.g. the `largeIcon` property associated with the `AndroidNotificationDetails` class) where a value that is an instance of the `DrawableResourceAndroidBitmap` means the bitmap should be loaded from an drawable resource. If this is an instance of the `FilePathAndroidBitmap`, this indicates it should be loaded from a file referred to by a given file path.

‚ö†Ô∏è For Android 8.0+, sounds and vibrations are associated with notification channels and can only be configured when they are first created. Showing/scheduling a notification will create a channel with the specified id if it doesn't exist already. If another notification specifies the same channel id but tries to specify another sound or vibration pattern then nothing occurs.

#### Scheduled notifications

If your application needs the ability to schedule notifications then you need to request permissions to be notified when the phone has been booted as scheduled notifications uses the `AlarmManager` API to determine when notifications should be displayed. However, they are cleared when a phone has been turned off. Requesting permission requires adding the following to the manifest (i.e. your application's `AndroidManifest.xml` file)

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
```

The following is also needed to ensure notifications remain scheduled upon a reboot and after an application is updated

```xml
<receiver android:name="com.dexterous.flutterlocalnotifications.ScheduledNotificationBootReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED"/>
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

Developers will also need to add the following so that plugin can handle displaying scheduled notifications

```xml
<receiver android:name="com.dexterous.flutterlocalnotifications.ScheduledNotificationReceiver" />
```

If the vibration pattern of an Android notification will be customised then add the following

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
```

For reference, the example app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file can be found [here](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/blob/master/flutter_local_notifications/example/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)


#### Release build configuration

Before creating the release build of your app (which is the default setting when building an APK or app bundle) you will likely need to customise your ProGuard configuration file as per this [link](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#keep-code) and add the following line:

```
-keep class com.dexterous.** { *; }
```

After doing so, rules specific to the GSON dependency being used by the plugin will also needed to be added. These rules can be found [here](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/examples/android-proguard-example/proguard.cfg). The example app has a consolidated Proguard rules (`proguard-rules.pro`) file that combines these together for reference [here](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/blob/master/flutter_local_notifications/example/android/app/proguard-rules.pro).

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that you have configured the resources that should be kept so that resources like your notification icons aren't discarded by the R8 compiler by following the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#keep-resources). Without doing this, you might not see the icon you've specified in your app's notifications. The configuration used by the example app can be found [here](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/blob/master/flutter_local_notifications/example/android/app/src/main/res/raw/keep.xml) where it is specifying that all drawable resources should be kept, as well as the file used to play a custom notification sound (sound file is located [here](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/blob/master/flutter_local_notifications/example/android/app/src/main/res/raw/slow_spring_board.mp3)).



## ‚öôÔ∏è iOS setup

#### General setup

Add the following lines to the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method in the AppDelegate.m/AppDelegate.swift file of your iOS project

Objective-C:
```objc
if (@available(iOS 10.0, *)) {
  [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter].delegate = (id<UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate>) self;
}
```

Swift:
```swift
if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
  UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self as? UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate
}
```

#### Handling notifications whilst the app is in the foreground
By design, iOS applications *do not* display notifications the app is in the foreground. 

For iOS 10+, use the presentation options to control the behaviour for when a notification is triggered while the app is in the foreground. 

For older versions of iOS, you need to handle the callback as part of specifying the method that should be fired to the `onDidReceiveLocalNotification` argument when creating an instance `IOSInitializationSettings` object that is passed to the function for initializing the plugin. 

Here is an example:

```dart
// initialise the plugin. app_icon needs to be a added as a drawable resource to the Android head project
var initializationSettingsAndroid =
    AndroidInitializationSettings('app_icon');
var initializationSettingsIOS = IOSInitializationSettings(
    onDidReceiveLocalNotification: onDidReceiveLocalNotification);
var initializationSettings = InitializationSettings(
    initializationSettingsAndroid, initializationSettingsIOS);
flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(initializationSettings,
    onSelectNotification: onSelectNotification);

...

  Future onDidReceiveLocalNotification(
      int id, String title, String body, String payload) async {
    // display a dialog with the notification details, tap ok to go to another page
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) => CupertinoAlertDialog(
            title: Text(title),
            content: Text(body),
            actions: [
              CupertinoDialogAction(
                isDefaultAction: true,
                child: Text('Ok'),
                onPressed: () async {
                  Navigator.of(context, rootNavigator: true).pop();
                  await Navigator.push(
                    context,
                    MaterialPageRoute(
                      builder: (context) => SecondScreen(payload),
                    ),
                  );
                },
              )
            ],
          ),
    );
  }

```



## ‚ùì Usage
Before going on to copy-paste the code snippets in this section, double-check you have configured your application correctly.
If you encounter any issues please refer to the API docs and the sample code in the `example` directory before opening a request on Github.

### Example app
The `example` directory has a sample application that demonstrates the features of this plugin.

### API reference
Checkout the lovely [API documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_local_notifications/latest/flutter_local_notifications/flutter_local_notifications-library.html) generated by pub. 


## Initialisation

The first step is to create a new instance of the plugin class and then initialise it with the settings to use for each platform

```dart
FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin = FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin();
// initialise the plugin. app_icon needs to be a added as a drawable resource to the Android head project
var initializationSettingsAndroid = AndroidInitializationSettings('app_icon');
var initializationSettingsIOS = IOSInitializationSettings(
    onDidReceiveLocalNotification: onDidReceiveLocalNotification);
var initializationSettings = InitializationSettings(
    initializationSettingsAndroid, initializationSettingsIOS);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(initializationSettings,
    onSelectNotification: selectNotification);
```

Initialisation should only be done **once**, and this can be done is in the `main` function of your application. Alternatively, this can be done within the first page shown in your app. Developers can refer to the example app that has code for the initialising within the `main` function. The code above has been simplified for explaining the concepts. Here we have specified the default icon to use for notifications on Android (refer to the *Android setup* section) and designated the function (`selectNotification`) that should fire when a notification has been tapped on via the `onSelectNotification` callback. Specifying this callback is entirely optional but here it will trigger navigation to another page and display the payload associated with the notification.

```dart
Future selectNotification(String payload) async {
    if (payload != null) {
      debugPrint('notification payload: ' + payload);
    }
    await Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen(payload)),
    );
}
```

In the real world, this payload could represent the id of the item you want to display the details of. Once the initialisation is complete, then you can manage the displaying of notifications.

On iOS, initialisation may show a prompt to requires users to give the application permission to display notifications (note: permissions don't need to be requested on Android). Depending on when this happens, this may not be the ideal user experience for your application. If so, please refer to the next section on how to work around this.

‚ö† If the app has been launched by tapping on a notification created by this plugin, calling `initialize` is what will trigger the `onSelectNotification` to trigger to handle the notification that the user tapped on. An alternative to handling the "launch notification" is to call the `getNotificationAppLaunchDetails` method that is available in the plugin. This could be used, for example, to change the home route of the app for deep-linking. Calling `initialize` will still cause the `onSelectNotification` callback to fire for the launch notification. It will be up to developers to ensure that they don't process the same notification twice (e.g. by storing and comparing the notification id).

### [iOS only] Requesting notification permissions

The constructor for the `IOSInitializationSettings` class has three named parameters (`requestSoundPermission`, `requestBadgePermission` and `requestAlertPermission`) that controls which permissions are being requested. If you want to request permissions at a later point in your application on iOS, set all of the above to false when initialising the plugin.

```dart
FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin =  FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin();
var initializationSettingsAndroid =
    AndroidInitializationSettings('app_icon');
var initializationSettingsIOS = IOSInitializationSettings(
        requestSoundPermission: false,
        requestBadgePermission: false,
        requestAlertPermission: false,
        onDidReceiveLocalNotification: onDidReceiveLocalNotification,
    );
var initializationSettings = InitializationSettings(
    initializationSettingsAndroid, initializationSettingsIOS);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(initializationSettings,
    onSelectNotification: onSelectNotification);
```

Then call the `requestPermissions` method with desired permissions at the appropriate point in your application

```dart
var result = await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin
          .resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<
              IOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>()
          ?.requestPermissions(
            alert: true,
            badge: true,
            sound: true,
          );
```

Here the call to `flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<IOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>()` returns the iOS implementation of the plugin that contains APIs specific to iOS if the application is running on iOS. The `?.` operator is used here as the result will be null when run on other platforms. Developers may alternatively choose to guard this call by checking the platform their application is running on.

### Displaying a notification

```dart
var androidPlatformChannelSpecifics = AndroidNotificationDetails(
    'your channel id', 'your channel name', 'your channel description',
    importance: Importance.Max, priority: Priority.High, ticker: 'ticker');
var iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics = IOSNotificationDetails();
var platformChannelSpecifics = NotificationDetails(
    androidPlatformChannelSpecifics, iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
    0, 'plain title', 'plain body', platformChannelSpecifics,
    payload: 'item x');
```

In this block of code, the details for each platform have been specified. This includes the channel details that is required for Android 8.0+. The payload has been specified ('item x'), that will passed back through your application when the user has tapped on a notification. 

On Android devices, notifications will **only** in appear in the tray and **won't** appear as a toast (heads-up notification) unless things like the priority/importance has been set appropriately. Refer to the [Android docs] (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html#Heads-up) for more information. 

The "ticker" text is passed here though it is optional and specific to Android. This allows for text to be shown in the status bar on older versions of Android when the notification is shown.

### Scheduling a notification

```dart
var scheduledNotificationDateTime =
        DateTime.now().add(Duration(seconds: 5));
var androidPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails('your other channel id',
        'your other channel name', 'your other channel description');
var iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    IOSNotificationDetails();
NotificationDetails platformChannelSpecifics = NotificationDetails(
    androidPlatformChannelSpecifics, iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.schedule(
    0,
    'scheduled title',
    'scheduled body',
    scheduledNotificationDateTime,
    platformChannelSpecifics);
```

On Android devices, the default behaviour is that the notification may not be delivered at the specified time when the device in a low-power idle mode. This behaviour can be changed by setting the optional parameter named `androidAllowWhileIdle` to true when calling the `schedule` method.

### Periodically showing a notification with a specified interval

```dart
// Show a notification every minute with the first appearance happening a minute after invoking the method
var androidPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails('repeating channel id',
        'repeating channel name', 'repeating description');
var iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    IOSNotificationDetails();
var platformChannelSpecifics = NotificationDetails(
    androidPlatformChannelSpecifics, iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.periodicallyShow(0, 'repeating title',
    'repeating body', RepeatInterval.EveryMinute, platformChannelSpecifics);
```

### Showing a daily notification at a specific time

```dart
var time = Time(10, 0, 0);
var androidPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails('repeatDailyAtTime channel id',
        'repeatDailyAtTime channel name', 'repeatDailyAtTime description');
var iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    IOSNotificationDetails();
var platformChannelSpecifics = NotificationDetails(
    androidPlatformChannelSpecifics, iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.showDailyAtTime(
    0,
    'show daily title',
    'Daily notification shown at approximately ${_toTwoDigitString(time.hour)}:${_toTwoDigitString(time.minute)}:${_toTwoDigitString(time.second)}',
    time,
    platformChannelSpecifics);
```

### Showing a weekly notification on specific day and time

```dart
var time = Time(10, 0, 0);
var androidPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails('show weekly channel id',
        'show weekly channel name', 'show weekly description');
var iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    IOSNotificationDetails();
var platformChannelSpecifics = NotificationDetails(
    androidPlatformChannelSpecifics, iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.showWeeklyAtDayAndTime(
    0,
    'show weekly title',
    'Weekly notification shown on Monday at approximately ${_toTwoDigitString(time.hour)}:${_toTwoDigitString(time.minute)}:${_toTwoDigitString(time.second)}',
    Day.Monday,
    time,
    platformChannelSpecifics);
```

### Retrieveing pending notification requests

```dart
var pendingNotificationRequests =
        await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.pendingNotificationRequests();
```

### [Android only] Grouping notifications

This is a "translation" of the sample available at https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/group.html
For iOS, you could just display the summary notification (not shown in the example) as otherwise the following code would show three notifications 

```dart
String groupKey = 'com.android.example.WORK_EMAIL';
String groupChannelId = 'grouped channel id';
String groupChannelName = 'grouped channel name';
String groupChannelDescription = 'grouped channel description';
// example based on https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/group.html
AndroidNotificationDetails firstNotificationAndroidSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails(
        groupChannelId, groupChannelName, groupChannelDescription,
        importance: Importance.Max,
        priority: Priority.High,
        groupKey: groupKey);
NotificationDetails firstNotificationPlatformSpecifics =
    NotificationDetails(firstNotificationAndroidSpecifics, null);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(1, 'Alex Faarborg',
    'You will not believe...', firstNotificationPlatformSpecifics);
AndroidNotificationDetails secondNotificationAndroidSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails(
        groupChannelId, groupChannelName, groupChannelDescription,
        importance: Importance.Max,
        priority: Priority.High,
        groupKey: groupKey);
NotificationDetails secondNotificationPlatformSpecifics =
    NotificationDetails(secondNotificationAndroidSpecifics, null);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
    2,
    'Jeff Chang',
    'Please join us to celebrate the...',
    secondNotificationPlatformSpecifics);

// create the summary notification required for older devices that pre-date Android 7.0 (API level 24)
List<String> lines = List<String>();
lines.add('Alex Faarborg  Check this out');
lines.add('Jeff Chang    Launch Party');
InboxStyleInformation inboxStyleInformation = InboxStyleInformation(
    lines,
    contentTitle: '2 new messages',
    summaryText: 'janedoe@example.com');
AndroidNotificationDetails androidPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails(
        groupChannelId, groupChannelName, groupChannelDescription,
        styleInformation: inboxStyleInformation,
        groupKey: groupKey,
        setAsGroupSummary: true);
NotificationDetails platformChannelSpecifics =
    NotificationDetails(androidPlatformChannelSpecifics, null);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
    3, 'Attention', 'Two new messages', platformChannelSpecifics);
```

### Cancelling/deleting a notification

```dart
// cancel the notification with id value of zero
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.cancel(0);
```

### Cancelling/deleting all notifications

```dart
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.cancelAll();
```


### Getting details on if the app was launched via a notification created by this plugin

```dart
 var notificationAppLaunchDetails =
     await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.getNotificationAppLaunchDetails();
```

### [iOS only] Periodic notifications showing up after reinstallation

If you have set notifications to be shown periodically on older iOS versions (< 10) and the application was uninstalled without cancelling all alarms, then the next time it's installed you may see the "old" notifications being fired. If this is not the desired behaviour then you can add code similar to the following to the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your `AppDelegate` class.


Objective-C:

```objc
if(![[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]objectForKey:@"Notification"]){
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] cancelAllLocalNotifications];
    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]setBool:YES forKey:@"Notification"];
}
```

Swift:

```swift
if(!UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "Notification")) {
    UIApplication.shared.cancelAllLocalNotifications()
    UserDefaults.standard.set(true, forKey: "Notification")
}
```
