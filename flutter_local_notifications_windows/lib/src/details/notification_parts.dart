/// Windows supports a few different URI types, and supports them differently
/// depending on if your app is packaged as an MSIX. Refer to the following:
///
/// | URI | Debug | Release (EXE) | Release (MSIX) |
/// |--------|--------|--------|--------|
/// | `http(s)://` | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
/// | `ms-appx://` | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
/// | `file:///`   | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | üü® |
/// | `getAssetUri()` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
///
/// Each URI type has different uses:
/// - For Flutter assets, use [getAssetUri], which return the correct file URI
/// for debug and release (exe) builds, and an `ms-appx` URI in MSIX builds.
/// - For images from the web, use an `https` or `http` URI, but note that
/// these only work in MSIX apps. If you need a network image without using
/// MSIX, consider downloading it directly and using a file URI after. Also
/// note that showing the notification will cause the image to be downloaded,
/// which could cause a small delay. Try to use small images.
/// - For images that come from the user's device, or have to be retrieved at
/// runtime, use a file URI, but as always, be aware of how paths might change
/// from your device to your users. Note that file URIs must be absolute
/// paths, not relative, which can be complicated if referring to MSIX assets.
/// - For images that are bundled with your app but not through Flutter, use
/// an `ms-appx` URI.
